### Overview

Semi-autonomous systems are those with some aspects of both autonomous and human control.

In this example, a reinforcement learning agent is trained to avoid the bad asteroids while following the human control instruction as closely as possible. This type of smoothing-out of human control will become more prevalent in semi-autonomous operation systems in the coming years.
